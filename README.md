# Tic-Tac-Toe-project
This is a Java program for a Tic Tac Toe game that allows the user to play against an AI that uses the minimax algorithm to determine its moves.
This is my uni project for Java and it has a lot of files. This first one explain how the game works in general, the 3x3 explains how the hard mode works. This is a custom project and I would like to share it to everyone
